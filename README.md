# Python Terminal Game
The project is a simple command-line based game that involves a police officer trying to catch a robber who has stolen money. The game requires the user to input commands to move, take cover or shoot at the robber. The project is written in Python and uses the random, time, and os modules.

## How to Play
    1. You need 2 players to play
    2. Each player starts with 5 Hearts, 5 Ammo & 5 Energy
    3. Choose to Move, Shoot, or Go behind cover on your turn
    4. Moving consumes 1 Energy, shooting consumes 1 Ammo and reduces opponent's health by 1
    5. Going behind cover fully restores Ammo and Energy, and avoids damage from being shot
    6. Moving or shooting automatically makes you lose cover
    7. The game ends when a player loses all their hearts or the distance between players reaches 0 or 50.
